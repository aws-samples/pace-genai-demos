# This configuration file is for Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer.
# You must name your file aws-codeguru-reviewer.yml for CodeGuru Reviewer to recognize it.
# Add the file to the root directory of your repository.
# For more information, see the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/welcome.html.

# Exclude files and directories
# Use glob pattern syntax to specify the files and directories that you want to exclude 
# from analysis under excludeFiles. For more information, see glob (programming): 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming).
# The following example excludes from analysis all content in the some-package directory, all content 
# in the tst directory, and all JSON files in a sub-directory under a directory prefixed with some-.
# Replace with your own list of files and directories that you want CodeGuru Reviewer to exclude.
# We recommend that you use a schema validator to confirm that the YAML syntax is valid.
