# Generative AI demos using Amazon Kendra,LangChain and large language models using enterprise data

This repository provides code samples for three Generative AI demos, licensed under MIT-0 license.

1. **Amazon Kendra with foundational LLM**: Utilizes the deep search capabilities of Amazon
   Kendra combined with the expansive knowledge of Large Language Models. This
   integration provides precise and context-aware answers to complex queries by drawing
   from a diverse range of sources.

2. **Embeddings model with foundational LLM**: Merges the power of embeddings—a
   technique to capture semantic meanings of words and phrases—with the vast
   knowledge base of LLMs. This synergy enables more accurate topic modeling, content
   recommendation, and semantic search capabilities.

3. **Foundation Models Pharma Ad Generator**: A specialized application tailored for the
   pharmaceutical industry. Harnessing the generative capabilities of foundational models,
   this tool creates convincing and compliant pharmaceutical advertisements, ensuring
   content adheres to industry standards and regulations

These demos can be seamlessly deployed in your AWS account, offering foundational insights and guidance on utilizing AWS services to create a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) Generative AI Question and Answer Bot and content generation.

You can deploy these demo's independent of each other. Please refer to the Readme files in each of the folders for deployment instructions.

Refer to the blog post for details on how these solutions work. Before you begin using the solution, there are certain precautions you must take into account:

- **Licensing obligations**: If you choose to use any datasets or models alongside the provided samples, ensure you check the LLM code and comply with all licensing obligations attached to them.

- **This is a sample**: the code provided in this repository shouldn't be used for production workloads without further reviews and adaptation.
